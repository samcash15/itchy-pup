# itchy-pup
An app to track your pup's itch levels.

This idea is thanks to my extremely allergic pup, Finley.
We go to a Dermatologist for him and it has been a long, tedious process to get him diagnosed with Environment Allergies and Food Allergies.
During the induction period of his allergy shots, we had to track his Itch Levels. This is where this app idea came from. This can be a pretty 
tedious process because we weren't just rating him on a scale of 1-10. 1 being completely normal and no itching, to 10, he is eating his skin off today.
Our doctor wanted us to track all the symptoms like paws, redness, dandruff, anal glands, ear itching, etc. along with the date/time we were giving the shots.

My hope with this app is to create something simple for the users to quickly track their dog's itch level, symptoms, etc, and have this easy and simple display to
review. Along with, eventually being able to export this data and email it directly to your vet.

I would like to also implement the Google Pollen API to send push notifications to the user based on the day if your pets allergies align with what you have inputted as your dogs environment allergy.
